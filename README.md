## Data Generation üîß
For our experiment, we used [Pyedu](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hkust-nlp/CodeIO-PyEdu-Reasoning-Raw) dataset released by [CodeI/O](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.07316). If you want to reproduce our data generation, download the Pyedu dataset and place it under `data/`. For a quick start, we provide a small subset of the data under `data/`.

### Data Generation Pipeline
Execute the following Python scripts to generate an execution trace for each coding problem and filter out unsuccessful executions. We employ a Python debugging tool called [Snoop](https://github.com/alexmojaki/snoop) to record detailed line-by-line execution signals, which will serve as a basis for grounded supervision for enhanced reasoning.
```bash
python src/filter_raw_data.py
python src/generate_exeuction_trace.py
python src/filter_execution_trace.py
```
Then, use a Translator model to translate the execution traces to a more natural form of reasoning. The `nl_trace` field in the resulting file will contain the translated execution trace. 
```bash
python src/execution_trace_translation.py --translator_model Qwen/Qwen3-32B --num_gpus 8
```
Run the following script to convert the final data into training data compatible with [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory).
```bash
python src/data_construction.py --trained_model Qwen/Qwen3-4B
```
